## 📖 About the Project

**Deep Explore** is a repository documenting my journey into Deep Learning. It serves as a comprehensive log of my creative process, bridging the gap between theoretical concepts and practical implementation.

The goal of this project is to explore fundamental and advanced architectures, experimenting with real-world data to understand the underlying mathematics and logic of neural networks.

## 🔬 Current Focus: Medical Imaging & Autoencoders

I am currently working on **Unsupervised Learning** applied to medical data. Specifically, I am developing **Autoencoders (AE)** and **Variational Autoencoders (VAE)** to learn efficient latent representations of **Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)** scans.

### Objectives
- **Dimensionality Reduction:** Compressing high-dimensional MRI data into a compact latent space.
- **Feature Extraction:** capturing essential anatomical features without human supervision.
- **Reconstruction:** Ensuring the decoder can accurately reconstruct images from the latent vector.
